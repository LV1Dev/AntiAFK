# AntiAFK

Very simple .py script that i made for Wayfinder game. The script's purpose is to keep the player character active in the game by simulating random key presses at irregular intervals, preventing the game from detecting prolonged inactivity and potentially kicking the player out of the game. This can be useful in situations where a game has an AFK detection system that penalizes players for being idle.

⏱️ once when you run it you have 5 seconds to go back to your game

P.S. 

line 6 - you can edit keys you want to be pressed
line 16 - you can edit wait delay before script starts
